## Lexical_Analyzer_Project
  Lexical Analyzer Project in C++ : In computer science, lexical analysis is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens. 
  A program or function which performs lexical analysis is called a lexical analyzer, lexer, or scanner. 
  A lexer often exists as a single function which is called by a parser or another function. Some popular tools like Lex and Yacc are examples of practical usage of lexical analysis.
